      <h1 class="text-center">Evaluating Driver Performance, Situation Awareness, and Cognitive Load at Different 
        Levels of Partial Autonomy with Dynamic Task Allocation</h1>
      <p></p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The current state of the art of autonomous vehicles requires operators to 
      be vigilant enough to take over the driving at anytime while being able to 
      perform other tasks unrelated to the driving task. It is important for this 
      reason to know how the autonomous system affects driving performance, cognitive 
      load, and situation awareness.</p>

      <p>The goal of this research was to model operator situation awareness, cognitive 
      load, driving performance, and secondary task performance at high levels of autonomy 
      using dynamically allocated secondary tasks. Each level of partial autonomy had its own 
      rates where the operator should have been able to respond to secondary tasks while still 
      staying vigilant enough to take over the driving task. There was also a rate at which the 
      secondary tasks could be rapidly presented for brief periods of time. This rapid rate was 
      consistent among all levels of partial autonomy. The experiment consisted of participants 
      operating a partially autonomous military vehicle while responding to secondary task questions 
      at the designated rates. There was a three-minute familiarization phase followed by a data 
      collection phase where participants had to prevent the autonomous vehicle from crashing into 
      random obstacles on the road.</p>

      <p>After the data collection phase, participants completed a brief survey. The data collection 
      phase was scored on the factors of driving performance, objective secondary task performance 
      based on latency and accuracy of responses to Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique 
      (SAGAT) questions, subjective situation awareness from the Situation Awareness Rating Technique 
      (SART), and cognitive load based on the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) and SOS Scale. They were 
      analyzed in terms of how they related to the autonomy level and compared to data gathered in a 
      similar study where tasks were presented at specific rates. The data was also used to validate the 
      model developed in that study.</p>

      <h3>Research Question</h3>
      <p>How are operator cognitive load, situation awareness, driving performance, and task performance 
      impacted when secondary tasks are dynamically automated based on the level of autonomy?</p>

      <h3>Hypotheses</h3>
      <p>H1: Participantsâ€™ situation awareness as measured by the Situation Awareness Rating
        Technique (SART) as well as real-time prompts based on the Situation Awareness
        Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) will be higher than what was observed in the previous 
        experiment at equivalent autonomy levels.
      </p>

      <p>H2: Participant cognitive load as measured by the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX)
      as well as an adapted version of the SOS scale will be lower than previously measured at equivalent autonomy levels.</p>

      <p>H3: Participants' ability to respond to sudden road events to take manual control and avoid collisions 
      will be higher than in the previous experiment.</p>

      <p>H4: Participants' average secondary task latency will be lower than in the previous experiment.</p>



      <h2>Experiment Setup</h2>
      <p>The study consisted of 150 participants, each randomly assigned to one of five autonomy conditions 
      (30 for each condition), and they took part in two drives (one practice drive and one data collection 
      drive). Participants took part in the study through a web-based driving simulator. They were placed 
      in a simulated environment where they operated a partially autonomous closed hatch military-type vehicle 
      with a small viewport for looking at the road and a screen for showing the secondary tasks that were in 
      the form of simple yes or no questions about the simulated environment. Participants were responsible for 
      safely operating the vehicle at their assigned level of autonomy while responding to secondary task questions 
      as quickly as possible. Three road events were encountered during the data collection drive that required 
      intervention. Participants also encountered stationary obstacles, barriers, and traffic. Participants were
      evaluated during the drive on driving performance and secondary task performance, which were scored by the 
      Situation Awareness Rating Technique (SART) as well as real-time probes for Situation Awareness Global 
      Assessment Technique (SAGAT) and cognitive load, which were scored by NASA-TLX and a modified SOS Scale.</p>

      <h3>Autonomy Levels</h3>
      <p>Each autonomy level had all the same functionality as previous conditions but added a new feature. 
      The features specific to each autonomy level are listed below:</p>
