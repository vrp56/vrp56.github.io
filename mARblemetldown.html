      <h1>mARble Meltdown</h1>
      <p> A simple mobile Augmented Reality game where you compete with another player to get your marbles close 
        to the center of the target. Do to time constraints during development, this game is played on one device 
        by passing the device between the players. This game was developed using Unity and ARFoundation for Android 
        devices and was tested on a Samsung Galaxy S8. The project can be found on my GitHub 
        <a href="https://github.com/vrp56-School-Projects/Game2" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <p></p>

      <h3>Board Placement</h3>
      <p>When the game opens up, the players has to move their phone around to detect a plane to play on. This can 
        be any horizontal surface, preferably one with distinguishing features. After a plane has been detected, 
        the board prefab will move to that position and the players can tap anywhere on the plane to lock the board 
        in place.</p>

        <p></p>

        <h3>Stage Selection</h3>
        <p>Once the board position has been set, the players will see a stage selection menu where they can cycle 
        through the differnt stages by tapping the option arrows. Once on the desired stage, it can be confirmed
        by tapping on the check button.</p>

        <p></p>
        
        <h3>Marble Selection</h3>
        <p>After the the stage has been selected, the players will see a Player 1 Options menu where Player 1 can 
        select their desired marble texture, trail, and hat. This is done similarly to stage selection and the 
        changes can be seen on the marble orbiting the menu. Once Player 1 has confirmed their settings, Player 
        2 will be allowed to do the same.</p>

        <p></p>
        <p></p>

        <h3>Player Turn</h3>
        <p>Once both players have finalized their settings, the competition begins. The player marble can be moved 
        along the edge of the board by moving the device left or right and confirming location by tapping the 
        check button. Each player will take turns launching their mable via a direction/power arrow that is 
        controlled by the check button under the board.</p>
